# My Music

This app enables users to search artists, view albums and listen the tracks. The data was obtained from Spotify API and route and query params were updated to ensure accuracy while fetching data. Supported user authorization with JWT & Passport, stored token in local storage so that user doesn’t get logged out. Integrated mongoose.js to persist user’s favorite tracks so they remain added when the user logs back in.
